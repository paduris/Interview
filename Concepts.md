**Data Structure:** A way to arrange a data so that it can processed efficiently.

**Algorithm** : A sequence of steps to solve a problem

**Techniques**

* Divide and Conquer
* Greedy
* Dynamic Programming


**Recursion**

```
recusrion(parameters)
{
    if( base cond is satisfied )
    {
        return value;
    }
    else{
        recursion(parameters)
    }
}
```

**Notations**
Omega
BigO

 
 **Binary Tree**
 
 * _Strict Binary Tree_ - If each node has either 2 children or none
 * _Full Binary Tree_ - If each non leaf node has 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level
 * _Complete Binary Tree_ : If all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible
